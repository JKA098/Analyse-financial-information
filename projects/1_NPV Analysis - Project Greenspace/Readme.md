## üåø Overview
Project Greenspace is a proposed investment initiative aimed at generating long-term revenue after an initial construction phase. The project involves a significant upfront investment followed by years of cash inflows and a final sale. This repository contains a financial model used to evaluate the project's viability using **Net Present Value (NPV)** analysis.

NPV helps assess the profitability of a project by calculating the present value of projected cash inflows and outflows, discounted at various rates. A positive NPV indicates a potentially profitable investment.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project Tasks and Instructions

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Baseline Scenario (Years 1‚Äì10)
- **Initial Investment (Year 1):** -$2,000,000
- **Construction Phase:** Years 2‚Äì3 (no cash inflows)
- **Revenue Generation:** Years 4‚Äì10
  - Revenue from Year 4 onward
  - **Year 10 Final Sale:** $1,000,000
- Objective: Find the discount rate where **NPV = 0**

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Reduced Revenue in Year 4
- **Year 4 Revenue:** Reduce from $250,000 to $50,000
- Rerun the model and observe changes in the NPV curve
- Determine the new breakeven discount rate

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Extended Project Timeline to 15 Years
- Update **Year 10 cash flow** from $1,000,000 to $500,000
- Add **Years 11‚Äì14:** $500,000 annually
- **Year 15:** Final sale of $1,000,000

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Update Cash Flow List (`project_a`)
```python
project_a = [
    -2000000, 0, 0, 250000, 300000, 400000, 500000, 600000, 750000,
    500000, 500000, 500000, 500000, 500000, 1000000
]
```
